# Clima Application â›…

## 10th Flutter Project
In this project I created a simple weather application that uses the current location of your device to show the weather.<br>
You can also click the City Icon on the top right of the app to get the weather of a desired location.<br>
Then you can click on the Current Location button on the top left corner of the app to get the weather of current location.<br>
